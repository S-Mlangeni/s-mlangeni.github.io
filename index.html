								<h3>Video Streaming Platform</h3>
								<p>	A web application that entertains users by providing them with on-demand video content. 
									Users can easily navigate through the different pages using the responsive navigation bar 
									to find their desired movies or series. The different movies and series are stored on Amazon S3 and are 
									retrieved by the custom backend server. The app’s custom sliders allow the user to easily navigate 
									through each row of content.
								</p>
								<p>The front- and back-end of the application were developed using (a) CSS, React styled-components, 
									and React JS, and (b) Express JS, respectively. The two ends connect using API requests and are 
									both hosted on the Heroku cloud platform, and the media files are stored on AWS. Click the “Demo” 
									button below to view the app.

									signing in, respectively. Once signing in credentials are validated, the user is directed 
									to the home page and greeted with a welcome message.
								</p>
								<p>The front- and back-end of the application were developed using (a) Bootstrap, CSS, and 
									Angular, and (b) the Java framework, Spring Boot, respectively. The two ends connect using

									trainer’s training programs, testimonials, and contact info. Users can leave the 
									trainer a message with their details on the app’s contact form. The contact form 
									is connected to a MongoDB database which stores the provided details. The responsiveness 
									of the app and its navigation bar provides the user with an amazing experience.
								</p>

									the user with a pdf confirmation letter with those details. The confirmation letter can either 
									be viewed on the browser or be sent to the user’s email address as an attachment. The details

									server are used to send the pdf document (confirmation letter) to the user’s email address 
									when requested.

								<h3>Stock Management System</h3>
								<p>	A web application that allows the user to retrieve and update stock levels of different 
									medications at different clinics in Africa. In the frontend, jQuery and AJAX are used to 
									retrieve the stock levels from the MySQL database through the PHP backend without reloading 
									the page. The stock levels can be updated by adding or removing stock using the user interface 
									which provides warnings for clinics with less than 5 items for each medication.
								</p>

								<h3>Login/Registration Form</h3>
								<p>	A web application that only allows registered users to access the first and second 
									page through providing valid credentials (i.e. their registered details). The user’s 
									credentials are stored in a MySQL database when registering and validated when the 
									user logs in. The application is secured as it does not allow access to its pages 
									(first and second page) through URL manipulation without valid credentials and when 
									logged out.
								</p>
								<p>The application was developed using Java EE which featured Java servlets, JSP files, 
									and CSS. It is hosted, along with its database, on Amazon Web Services (AWS) and can 
									be viewed using the “Demo” button below.

								<h3>Snake Game</h3>
								<p>A desktop application that allows the user to play and enjoy the classic snake game. The 
									game is played using the keyboard arrow keys and number keys (i.e. 2, 4, 6, and 8). The 
									application uses a graphic user interface (GUI) to provide visualizations of the elements 
									of the game.
								</p>
								<p>The application was developed using Java which featured swing components. It is presented 
									as a runnable .exe installer file which consists of an executable file bundled with the 
									Java Runtime Environment (JRE), thus allowing it to run on computers without a JRE. The 
									game can be downloaded and installed using the “Download Demo” button below.
